# Release Process

## Overview

A release for the bpfd project is comprised of the following major components:

- bpfd + bpfctl binaries
- Core GRPC API protobuf definitions
- Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Corresponding go pkg in the form of `github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd` which includes the following:
  - `github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/clients/gobpfd/v1`: The go client for the bpfd GRPC API
  - `github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/bpfd-operator/apis`: The go bindings for the
    bpfd CRD API
  - `github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/bpfd-operator/pkg/client`: The autogenerated
    clientset for the bpfd CRD API
  - `github.com/bpfd-dev/bpfd/bpfd-operator/pkg/helpers`: The provided bpfd CRD
    API helpers.
- Corresponding `bpfd-api`, `bpfd`, and `bpfctl` rust crates which house the rust client for the bpfd GRPC API
- The following core component container images with tag <RELEASE_VERSION>:
  - `quay.io/bpfd/bpfd`
  - `quay.io/bpfd/bpfctl`
  - `quay.io/bpfd/bpfd-operator`
  - `quay.io/bpfd/bpfd-agent`
  - `quay.io/bpfd/bpfd-operator-bundle`
- The relevant example bytecode container images with tag <RELEASE_VERSION> from source
  code located in the bpfd project:
  - `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go_xdp_counter`
  - `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go_tc_counter`
  - `quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/go_tracepoint_counter`
- The relevant example userspace container images with tag <RELEASE_VERSION> from source
  code located in the bpfd project:
  - `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go_xdp_counter`
  - `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go_tc_counter`
  - `quay.io/bpfd-userspace/go_tracepoint_counter`

## Versioning strategy

### Overview
Each new release of bpfd is defined with a "bundle version" that
represents the Git tag of a release, such as `v0.4.0`. This contains the
components described above

#### Kubernetes API Versions (e.g. v1alpha2, v1beta1)
Within the bpfd-operator, API versions are primarily used to indicate the stability of
a resource. For example, if a resource has not yet graduated to beta, it is
still possible that it could either be removed from the API or changed in
backwards incompatible ways. For more information on API versions, refer to the
[full Kubernetes API versioning
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning).

## Releasing a new version

### Writing a Changelog

To simplify release notes generation, we recommend using the [Kubernetes release
notes generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/cmd/release-notes):

```
go install k8s.io/release/cmd/release-notes@latest
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
release-notes --start-sha EXAMPLE_COMMIT --end-sha EXAMPLE_COMMIT --branch main --repo bpfd --org bpfd-dev
```

This output will likely need to be reorganized and cleaned up a bit, but it
provides a good starting point. Once you're satisfied with the changelog, create
a PR. This must go through the regular PR review process and get merged into the
`main` branch. Approval of the PR indicates community consensus for a new
release.

### Release Steps

The following steps must be done by one of the [bpfd maintainers][bpfd-team]:

For a **PATCH** release:

- Create a new branch in your fork named something like `<githubuser>/release-x.x.x`. Use the new branch
  in the upcoming steps.
- Use `git` to cherry-pick all relevant PRs into your branch.
- Create a branch from the major-minor tag of interest i.e:
  `git checkout -b release-x.x.x <major.minor.patch>`
- Create a pull request of the `<githubuser>/release-x.x.x` branch into the `release-x.x` branch upstream
  Add a hold on this PR waiting for at least one maintainer/codeowner to provide a `lgtm`. This PR should:
  - Add a new changelog for the release
  - Update the cargo.toml versions for the bpfd-api, bpfd, and bpfctl crates
  - Update the bpfd-operator version in it's MAKEFILE and run `make bundle` to update the bundle version
- Verify the CI tests pass and merge the PR into `release-x.x`.
- Create a tag using the `HEAD` of the `release-x.x.x` branch. This can be done using the `git` CLI or
  Github's [release][release] page.
- The Release will be automatically created, after that is complete do the following:
  - run `make build-crd-install-yaml` and attach the crd install yaml for the version to the release.
  - manually build and attach a `bpfd-operator-install-vx.x.x.yaml` to provide an easy to use install
    yaml for the bpfd-operator.
  - manually build and attach the following files:
    - `go-xdp-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    - `go-tc-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    - `go-tracepoint-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    so that the examples for a given release can be easily deployed.

For a **MAJOR** or **MINOR** release:

- Open an update PR that:
  - Adds a new changelog for the release
  - Updates the cargo.toml versions for the bpfd-api, bpfd, and bpfctl crates
  - Updates the bpfd-operator version in it's MAKEFILE and run `make bundle` to update the bundle version
- Make sure CI is green and merge the update PR.
- Create a tag using the `HEAD` of the `main` branch. This can be done using the `git` CLI or
  Github's [release][release] page.
- Tag the release using the commit on `main` where the changelog update merged.
  This can  be done using the `git` CLI or Github's [release][release]
  page.
- The Release will be automatically created, after that is complete do the following:
  - run `make build-crd-install-yaml` and attach the crd install yaml for the version to the release.
  - manually build and attach a `bpfd-operator-install-vx.x.x.yaml` to provide an easy to use install
    yaml for the bpfd-operator.
  - manually build and attach the following files:
    - `go-xdp-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    - `go-tc-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    - `go-tracepoint-counter-install-vx.x.x.yaml`
    so that the examples for a given release can be easily deployed.
