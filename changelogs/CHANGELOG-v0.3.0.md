The v0.3.0 release is our second official minor release of the the bpfd project :celebrate

The following describes some of the major new features/updates: 

- The ability to list and get kernel information for ALL programs regardless
of if they were loaded by bpfd or another process

- Deprecation of bpfd specific UUIDs for each loaded program in favor of the
standard generated kernel ID for all programs regardless of what process loaded them.

- Support for some new bpf program types: 
    * `Uprobe`s
    * `Uretprobe`s
    * `Kprobes`s
    * `KretProbes`s
    Along with their corresponding K8s API CRD Resources (`Uprobe` and `Kprobe` CRDs)

- `bpfctl` got some exciting new features + functionality:
    * The ability to pre-pull a bytecode image from a remote repository for later use
    * The ability to get a program based on Kernel ID
    * The ability to load a program with user determined metadata labels which the user
    can later use to filter via a `bpfctl` list
    * Much better formatting and both kernel + bpfd information feedback on `load`, `list`
    and `get` calls

- For maps, multiple programs can now share the same maps via the `map_owner_id` field
allowing for data sharing across various programs which are loaded via bpfd

- Removal of the cert-manager dependency in the bpfd kubernetes deployment

- Preliminary CSI(Container Storage Interface) support which allows applications
to receive their maps in kubernetes applications with a simple custom volume type
